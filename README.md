### Decision
We decided to use the code that was the most efficient in terms of run time. This would mean traversing the arraylist from the biggest elements on the left to the smallest elements on the right.
### Time Complexity
* add(str) - O(N)
* isEmpty() - O(1)
* peekMin() - O(1)
* removeMin() - O(1)

### Heap ToDo
- [x] ALHeap()
- [x] isEmpty()
- [x] peekMin()
- [x] toString()
- [x] add(addVal)
- [x] minChildPos(pos)
- [x] removeMin()
